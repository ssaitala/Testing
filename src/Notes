Create a student array of size 5.
Create a Student array of 8 (with different types of scores).
----Iteration Logic-----
For each student added, compare the other elements in the array and sort in the descending order. (For now, imagine all the factory elements
 are in descending order).

if the size increased by 5, then
	upon receiving another element, check to see if it is greater than the least element and find the correct slot of it.
	Once you get the correct slot, then 
	   move that element of the slot into a temporary variable and add this element there.
	   
	   Repeat the same process, until all the lower elements are replaced correctly. 
	   (As part of this, the least element gets removed).
	   
	   ---> More in depth of this is given in the below notes:
	   
----Iteration Logic End-----


For each iteration print the marks and the name.


Notes:

Maintain 2 variables, temp1 and temp2.

Suppose, if you have elements such as

98
87
75
67
58
47
30
21

and if you want to insert 82 now, then it does as follows:

 --> move 75 to temp1 and say usetemp1 = true and usetemp2 = false
 --> copy 82 in place of 75
 --> move 67 to temp2 and say usetemp1=false and usetemp2 = true
 --> move 75 in place of 67
 --> move 58 to temp1 and ....
